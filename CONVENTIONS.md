When writing python code, you MUST follow these principles:

- NEVER propose code that catches bare exceptions
- ALWAYS allow exceptions to propagate to the user, unless instructed otherwise. I want things to fail noisily!!
- Always start by thinking about tests; update an existing one, or write a new one
- Keep module sizes small
- Assume the use of `uv` for package management
- Code should be easy to read and understand.
- Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent.
- Functions should be small and do one thing well. They should not exceed a few lines.
- Function names should describe the action being performed.
- Prefer fewer arguments in functions. Ideally, aim for no more than two or three.
- Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make the code self-explanatory.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent from the code itself.
- Properly handle errors and exceptions to ensure the software's robustness.
- Use exceptions rather than error codes for handling errors.
- Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.
- Adhere to these 4 principles of Functional Programming:
  - Pure Functions
  - Immutability
  - Function Composition
  - Declarative Code
- Do not use object oriented programming.
