    Filter codelist versions to only those that are compatible with, or created from,
    the previous release. Any codelist versions that were not compatible with the previous

    We can only check versions that have hierarchies for compatibility.

    Note we don't exclude versions created from, or already in the compatible
    set, for THIS release.  If we're doing a forced-overwrite import (which is where
    we'd expect that might happen), we want to re-check compatibility.

    The compatibility check is conservative.  All we're aiming to do here is to say
    that a codelist version with the same codes and searches, would look the same in this
    new release of the coding system.  In order to do this, we check both its search
    results and its hierarchy, which represents the section of the coding system extended
    both parent-wise and child-wise from the associated codes on the codelist version.

    We do NOT check versions that are in draft status, as they are subject to change.
    Drafts are built/created with a specific coding system release, and any additional
    searches and included/excluded codes will be made with its assigned coding system
    release. When a draft is moved to under-review or published, its codes will not change,
    so it can be checked for compatibility against any newer releases at that point.

    To determine compatibility, we check:
    1) That a hierarchy built from the codelist version's codes is identical
    This indicates that the section of the coding system that relates to any code in
    the codelist (included OR excluded) is identical in the new release.
    CodelistVersion.codes represents all of a codelist version's included codes, however its
    codeset includes any descendants of those codes, whether included or excluded.
    A codelist's hierarchy is built in both directions, so it will include all parents right
    up to the root node, as well as the included/excluded code objs

    2) if the version has searches, rerun the searches with the new release and check that the

def _check_version_by_hierarchy(coding_system, version):
    r"""
    Check the compatibility of a codelist version with a specific coding system release
    by comparing the hierarchy generated from its codes.

    The version is compatible (on the basis of hierarchy) if
    a hierarchy built from the version's coding system release and included codes is
    identical to a hierarchy built from the comparison coding system release and the
    version's included codes.

    A hierarchy generated from a set of codes represents a subset of the coding system that
    includes all ancestors (up to the coding system's root node) and descendants of each code.

    e.g. For a coding system with this structure
           a
          / \
         b   c
        / \ / \
       d   e   f

    A codelist version that includes just the code 'f' will have the following hierarchy:
           a
            \
             c
              \
               f

    If there is a change in a different branch of the coding system - e.g. code 'd' is
    removed, will not affect the codelist version's hierarchy, and it will be considered
    compatible.

    However, if a change occurs in the branch that includes 'f', e.g. there is a new
    descendant code, 'g', the hierarchy will differ and the codelist version will be
    considered incompatible:
           a
          / \
         b   c
        / \ / \
       d   e   f
                \
                 g

    In the above case, there is now a new descendant code that needs to be included/excluded
    in the codelist version.

    If a change occurs in the ancestors of the included code 'f', e.g. 'c' is replaced by 'x':
           a
          / \
         b   x
        / \ / \
       d   e   f

    The hierarchy has changed, and the codelist version will be considered incompatible, even
    though there are no new descendant codes that need to be included or excluded.

    Note that our compatibility check is conservative and the fact that it is does not pass
    the compatiblity check does not mean that a new codelist version cannot be successfully
    created from this one with the new coding system release.

    Note that overall compatibility is determined based on both identical search results
    and identical hierarchies.
