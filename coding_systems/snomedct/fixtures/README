This directory contains the following JSON fixtures, which contain a slice of the SNOMED CT hierarchy:

* tennis-elbow.json
  * All SNOMED CT concepts related to Lateral epicondylitis (202855006)
  * Also contains inactive SNOMED CT concept (Epicondylitis &/or tennis elbow) or (golfers' elbow) (156659008)
  * Useful for tests that want to use some clinically-significant data
* tennis-toe.json
  * All SNOMED CT concepts related to Tennis toe (202855006)
  * Useful for tests that want to use some clinically-significant data
* core-model-components.json
  * All SNOMED CT concepts related to the magic numbers at the top of models.py
* model-components.json
  * All SNOMED CT concepts related to SNOMED CT Model Component (900000000000441003)

They were generated with eg:

  ./manage.py generate_snomedct_hierarchy_fixture 202855006 156659008 --path coding_systems/snomedct/fixtures/tennis-elbow.json

using data from International and UK releases in uk_sct2cl_29.1.0_20200415000001.

They can be loaded with eg:

  ./manage.py loaddata coding_systems/snomedct/fixtures/tennis-elbow.json

~~~

This directory also contains some example codelist CSV files.

* disorder-of-elbow.csv
  * Disorder of elbow (128133004) and all descendants
* disorder-of-elbow-excl-arthritis.csv
  * Disorder of elbow (128133004) and all descendants, except Arthritis (3723001) and all descendants
* disorder-of-elbow-excl-arthritis-only.csv
  * Disorder of elbow (128133004) and all descendants, except Arthritis (3723001)

They were originally generated by loading the tennis-elbow.json fixture and then running the now removed `generate_snomedct_codelist_fixture` management command, eg:

  ./manage.py generate_snomedct_codelist_fixture '128133004<' --path coding_systems/snomedct/fixtures/disorder-of-elbow.csv

Since then, the inactive concept 156659008 was added manually.
