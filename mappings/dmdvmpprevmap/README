DM+D VMP Previous Mappings
---------------------------

dm+d VMP ids sometimes change.  In a single dm+d release, each VMP record may
have a vmp_prev attribute, which indicates the id that this VMP used to be
known by.  However, only the last id is recorded, and VMP ids can change more
than once.

In order to map VMP ids in a dm+d codelist to any previous or subsequent ID,
we maintain a mapping of the current to previous IDs across historical releases.

Historical data from March 2019 to 12 Dec 2022 has been extracted from the
release downloads into a single csv file, located at
`/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/opencodelists/data/dmdvmpprevmap/dmd_vpid_vpidprev_mapping_20221208.csv.gz`
(See scripts/fetch_vmp_prev.py for re-creating/updating this file.)

For releases after 12 Dec 2022, the mappings are updated when each new release is
imported.

If the historical data needs to be re-imported, it can be run with:

    dokku run opencodelists python manage.py \
    import_mapping_data mapping.dmdvmpprevmap \
    /storage/data/dmdvmpprevmap/dmd_vpid_vpidprev_mapping_20221208.csv.gz
