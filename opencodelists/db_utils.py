class CodingSystemReleaseRouter:
    """
    A router to ensure coding system models always use a named release database.

    In order to maintain historical releases of Coding Systems, each new release is
    imported into a separate sqlite database, recorded as a CodingSystemRelease
    (see coding_systems.versioning.models.CodingSystemRelease).  The database for a
    coding system release is identified by <coding_system>_<release_name>_<valid_from date>
    e.g. "snomedct_v1_20221001", and any Django ORM commands that access coding
    system models are expected to make use of the `using` argument to specify the
    corresponding release database that should be used
    e.g. `Concept.objects.using("snomedct_v1_20221001").filter(...)`.

    For the most part, coding system databases are read-only, and for read queries, the
    `using` argument bypasses this router, by directly specifying which database to read from.

    However, writes for coding system models (typically only during data imports and tests) do
    go via the router.  In this case, the `hints` will contain an `instance`, which is either the
    model instance being created/saved or the foreign key relationship being created/modified
    (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/multi-db/#hints).  For a coding system
    model, the instance will have a release database assigned to it, which is the database we return
    for the write operation.

    This router also serves to prevent database migrations on models that they should not
    have access to.  i.e. migrations for snomedct models are only allowed for databases whose
    aliases are in the form `snomedct_...`.  Any models that are not in coding sytem apps will
    be allowed to migrate in the default database only.  This means that coding system databases
    ONLY contain their relevant tables, and the default database ONLY contains non-coding system
    tables.
