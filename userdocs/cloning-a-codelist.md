## Cloning a codelist

You can make a clone, or copy, of a codelist that is owned by an organisation, another user, or even yourself.
To do this, click _Clone this codelist_ on the codelist homepage.

This will create a clone of the most recent version of this codelist in your codelists,
with the same name as the source codelist, and all of its metadata (including a link back to the source codelist).

If you clone one of your own codelists, to avoid a clash of names `(clone)` will be added to the codelist name,
plus a number if you make further clones of that clone.

You may now make edits to this clone, including creating new versions, just as if it were a codelist you had created from scratch.
