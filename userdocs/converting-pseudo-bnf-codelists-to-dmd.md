## Converting Pseudo-BNF codelists to dm+d

Pseudo-BNF and the NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d) are both medication coding systems in regular use in the UK.

The NHS regularly publishes a file which maps BNF codes to dm+d codes, which we ingest into OpenCodelists, allowing you to convert your Pseudo-BNF codelists to dm+d.

To convert a Pseudo-BNF codelists to dm+d:

1. Go to the page for Pseudo-BNF codelist you wish to convert.
1. If there are multiple versions of the Pseudo-BNF codelist, select the relevant codelist version.
1. Click the "Convert to dm+d" button.

This will create a new codelist with the same name as your Pseudo-BNF codelist but with a "-dmd" suffix, and you will be taken to its page.
The methodology statement of this dm+d codelist contains a link back to your original Pseudo-BNF. As with any other codelist, you are free to edit this statement, and all other codelist metadata.

If you wish to update this converted codelist
(for example, after an update to the Pseudo-BNF list, the Pseudo-BNF coding system, or the Pseudo-BNF to dm+d mappings):

1. Return to the Pseudo-BNF codelist.
1. Click the "Convert to dm+d" button again

A new version of the dm+d codelist will be created.

If this new version is identical to an existing version of the codelist (i.e. there are no changes in the dm+d codes), you will be shown an error and the new version will not be created.
