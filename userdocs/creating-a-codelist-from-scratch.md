## Creating a codelist from scratch with the builder

Our codelist builder tool helps you create a codelist from scratch,
by searching terms and choosing which matching concepts should be included.

When signed in, click _My codelists_ in the top right of any page.

Then click _Create a codelist_.

Choose a name for the codelist, and select a coding system from the dropdown.  If you are a member of an organisation, you can also choose an owner for the codelist (your own account or an organisation account).

We currently support codelists using the following coding systems:

- SNOMED CT
- ICD-10
- CTV3 (Read V3)
- BNF (British National Formulary codes)

Then click _Create_.

You'll be taken to a page that is nearly blank.

You build your codelist by searching for terms or codes, and then choosing which of the matching concepts should be included in the codelist.  To search for a code, prefix it with "code:" in the search field.

Any concepts that match your search term, and their descendants, are shown in a hierarchy.

In order to keep the page manageable, only two levels of the hierarchy are initially visible.
You can drill down the hierarchy by clicking the `âŠž` button next to a concept.

You include a concept by clicking the `+` button, and exclude a concept by clicking the `-` button.
When you include or exclude a concept, all of its descendants are also included or excluded.
Explicitly included/excluded concepts have buttons highlighted blue;
their descendants have buttons highlighted grey.

If you have included or excluded a result by mistake, you can undo this by clicking on the include or exclude button again.

Sometimes a code can be _in conflict_.
This happens when one of its ancestors in included and another is excluded.
For instance, _Acute severe exacerbation of mild persistent allergic asthma_
is a descendant of both _Mild asthma_ and _Acute asthma_.

        conflict-1.png

You can click on the _..._ to the right of the term to see more details.

There is a link to see just the concepts that are unresolved or in conflict.

All the searches used to build the codelist are displayed, and you can view the results of specific searches again by clicking on them.  _Show all_ returns to the combined results of all searches.

You can also delete a search by clicking the __x__ next to it.  If you have already included some concepts from that search, they will not be removed.

Once you have included or excluded every search result, you are able to save your changes.
If you are not done with building your codelists, you can _Save draft_ and come back to finish editing it later.

If you're done building the codelist, you can save it for review. Note that the __Save for review__ button will be disabled if you have unresolved or conflicting codes in the codelist.  __Save for review__  takes you to the codelist's homepage, where you can edit metadata to provide a description, methodology, links to references, and sign offs.


The codelist is still not publicly available to allow for it to be reviewed and signed off.  You can copy its URL and send it to a another OpenCodelists user to review. The reviewer signs off by editing the codelist's metadata and adding their user and the date in the sign offs section.

Procedures for reviewing and signing off codelists may vary between organisations.  For more
information on procedures for building codelists to use in OpenSAFELY research, see the
[OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/codelist-intro/).

Once the codelist is reviewed, it can be published, using the __Publish version__ link from the codelist's homepage.  Publishing a codelist version will make that version permanent, and will delete any other draft or in-review versions.
