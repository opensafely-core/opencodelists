## Editing a codelist

You can edit a codelist that you own, or that is owned by an organisation that you belong to.
To do this, click _Create new version_ on the codelist homepage.

This will open the builder, with all of the codes from your codelist selected.
Additionally, if the codelist was created through the builder,
then any terms that were searched for will be present.

You can search for new terms,
and you can change whether any concepts are included or excluded.

You can discard your changes by clicking _Discard_.
You can also save a draft version of your codelist by clicking _Save as draft_.
And when all concepts have been resolved,
you can save your changes and create a new version for review by clicking _Save for review_.

Importantly, the original version of your codelist is still accessible at the same URL.
