## Organisations

If you are a member of an OpenCodelists organisation, you will see a _My organisations_ menu option.

_My organisations_ allows you to view codelists that are owned by your organisations, or that are waiting for review.

Any OpenCodelists user with an account can create a codelist. However, to create or edit codelists on behalf of an organisation, you must be a member of that organisation.

To join an organisation:

* Contact your organisation administrator.
* Your administrator will need your OpenCodelists username or email address in order to add you to the organisation.
