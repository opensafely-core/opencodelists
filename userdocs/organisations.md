## Organisations

If you are a member of an OpenCodelists organisation, you will see a _My organisations_ menu option, where you can view codelists that are owned by your organisations, or that are waiting for review.

Any OpenCodelists user with an account can create a codelist.  However, in order to create or edit codelists on behalf of an organisation, you must be a member of that organisation.  To join an organisation, please contact your organisation administrator.  Your administrator will need your OpenCodelists username or email address in order to add you to the organisation.
