## Status of the project

OpenCodelists has been used to create {numcodelists} codelists since April 2020, and it is in active development by staff at the Bennett Institute.

Codelists created with OpenCodelists are used in research projects all over the UK, both within and without the OpenSAFELY research ecosystem.

**Anybody** can use OpenCodelists to create and share codelists.
